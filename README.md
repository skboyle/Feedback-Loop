# Feedback Loop

Feedback Loop is a web app for music makers to improve their song writing skills by posting songs and sharing constructive critiques. User’s can log in though Spotify and browse a feed of album cover art. Clicking on a song brings users to the song’s show page which features info, critiques and a form for leaving feedback. User’s can favorite songs and make recommendations with embedded Spotify widgets, as well as view a playlist of all user recommended music. Feedback Loop encourages positive interactions and feedback is rated using an up-vote down-vote system. User’s can post a song of their own after giving three up-voted critiques.
